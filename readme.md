**Note:** To run the program you have to install graphics drivers that have support for OpenCL. Otherwise the program will complain of missing OpenCL libraries. The recent graphics driver packages from Intel/Nvidia/AMD will include the necessary files. 

## Features

- Multiplatform modern C++11/14 + OpenMP + OpenCL + OpenGL
  - Runs on 64-bit Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
  - Multithreaded using OpenMP
  - GPU features are implemented with OpenCL
  - OpenGL used for interactive mode only (display raytracing results with textured quads)
- Interactive and non-interactive mode
  - Interactive mode allows moving in the scene and editing primitives
  - Non-interactive mode renders the scene to an image file with helpful progress indicators
  - In the interactive mode the scene can be rendered in a lower resolution and then scaled up with good quality resampling shaders for real-time performance
- Raytracing (Whitted-style recursive algorithm)
  - Mirror and glossy reflections
  - Single and glossy refractions with refractive indices
  - Fresnel term with reflection/refraction
  - Attenuation by transparent objects (Beer's law)
  - Ambient, directional, point and spot lights
    - Phong shading (ambient, diffuse and specular terms)
    - Ambient light occlusion (hemisphere sampling for occlusion)
    - Soft shadows with point and spot lights (area light sampling)
  - Simpler version (ray casting) implemented for GPUs (OpenCL)
    - Works on scenes composed of triangles only (3, 18 and 19)
- Pathtracing
  - Cosine distribution sampling for diffuse surfaces
  - Functionally almost identical version implemented for GPUs (OpenCL)
    - Works on scenes composed of triangles only (3, 18 and 19)
- Sampling
  - Multisampling for antialiasing
    - Multiple filter types: box, tent, bell, gaussian, mitchell and lanczos sinc
  - Time sampling for motion blur
    - Camera and all primitives can move independently
  - Camera sampling for depth of field
    - Focal distance and aperture size
  - Different sampling distributions (both procedural and pre-generated)
    - Regular, random, jittered, correlated multi-jitter and poisson disc
- Primitives
  - Plane
  - Sphere
  - Box (slab method)
  - Triangle (MÃ¶ller-Trumbore algorithm)
  - Cylinder (2nd order polynomial)
  - Torus (4th order polynomial, Durand-Kerner algorithm root solver)
  - Blinn blobs / metaballs (regula falsi method root finder)
  - Constructive solid geometry (CSG)
    - All primitives can be used
    - Supports union, difference and intersection operations
  - Bounding volume hierarchy (BVH)
    - Can contain any primitives (also other BVHs)
    - Surface area heuristics (SAH) used for building
    - Flat construction and usage (no recursion)
  - Instance
    - Can duplicate any other primitive and apply different transformation and material
  - Primitive group
    - Used to combine multiple primitives (e.g. a model composed of triangles) to be used with an instance
- Camera projections
  - Orthogonal, perspective and fish eye projections supported
- Normal mapping
  - Tangent space calculated for triangles
  - Bump map images
  - Normal map images
  - Gradient normal mapping (normals are perturbed by a gradient calculated from a procedural 3D texture)
- Texture mapping
  - Sphere and triangle have UV mapping
  - HDR texture support
  - Bilinear filtering
- Procedural textures
  - Both 2D and 3D procedural generation
  - Solid color, gradient color and checkerboard textures
  - Perlin noise texture with fractional brownian motion (FBM)
  - Wood, marble and fire textures (based on perlin noise)
  - Cell noise texture with different distance metrics and combination operators
  - Voronoi color texture with different distance metrics
  - Atmosphere texture
- Simple and volumetric fog
  - Simple fog is based on distance and can be dispersed according to height
  - Volumetric fog is ray marched with single scattering
- Tone mapping
  - Linear, simple and Reinhard tone mappers
  - Gamma correction
  - Exposure and key adjustment
  - Delayed exposure adjustment with the Reinhard tone mapper (interactive mode)
- Image file format support
  - Loading textures from (and saving output to) PNG, TGA, BMP and HDR (Radiance RGBE) image file formats
- Model file format support
  - OBJ format
    - All valid OBJ files are supported (groups, relative indices etc.)
    - MTL files are supported (with added material properties)
  - PLY format
    - Both ascii and binary formats supported
    - No material support (single material for the whole model)
- Distributed network renderer
  - The program can be started in server mode in which it will announce its presence and wait for rendering jobs over the network
  - In client mode the program will listen for available servers and then divide the scene to be partially rendered by each server
  - Server discovery is done by UDP broadcasts and scene data and rendering results are sent over using TCP
- Serialization
  - All scene data can be serialized to XML, JSON or binary
  - Externally loaded models and generated BVHs can also be serialized for faster scene loading
- Math library
  - A simple and minimal math library implementation

## Instructions

Running the program will open the first test scene in an interactive windowed mode. Use WASD to move and left mouse button to look around. Cycle through the test scenes with F2/F3.

Edit the settings.ini file to further configure the program. Some options can be overridden with command line switches.
